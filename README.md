## Configuring FIR

For this integration to work, you must enable filtering on the "Artifacts" API Endpoint in FIR.  To do this, you have to modify the "views.py" file contained in /path/to/your/FIR/install/fir_api/views.py

1. Add the following entry to the top of the file in the list of Python module imports:
```
from rest_framework import filters
```

2. Append the following lines to the bottom of the "ArtifactViewSet" class:
```
filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
search_fields = ['value']
```

3. Restart FIR service
